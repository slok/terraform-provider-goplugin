The requirements for a plugin are:

- Written in Go.

- Implemented in a single package.
- Implement the [plugin v1 API](https://github.com/slok/terraform-provider-goplugin/tree/main/pkg/api/v1).

Check [examples](https://github.com/slok/terraform-provider-goplugin/tree/main/examples)

## Example Usage

```terraform
# We have a plugin loaded that has been registered as `os_file`.
# This plugin manages files in the system.
resource "goplugin_plugin_v1" "os_file_test" {
  plugin_id = "os_file"

## Schema

### Required

- `plugin_id` (String) The ID of the plugin to use, must be loaded and registered by the provider. To avoid inconsistencies, if changed the resource will be recreated.
- `resource_data` (String) A JSON string object with the properties that will be passed to the plugin resource, the plugin is responsible of knowing how to load and use these properties.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The resource ID, normally managed by terraform and the plugins logic.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import schema.
terraform import goplugin_plugin_v1.myresource ${PLUGIN_ID}/${RESOURCE_ID}

# Example:
# - We have a plugin registered as `github_gist`.
# - We have a resource managed by this plugin with the ID `04fb1aafb3074664089990ea793cb245`.
terraform import goplugin_plugin_v1.myresource github_gist/04fb1aafb3074664089990ea793cb245
```
