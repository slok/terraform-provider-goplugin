# goplugin Provider

The Go plugin provider is used to create dynamically Terraform providers using small go plugins (provider inception!).

It removes all the complexity and bootstrapping that has a regular Terraform provider development, however this comes with some
limitations. So depends on your use case this may be handy.

The plugins based providers, are similar to the regular Terraform providers but differ somehow:

- Not compiled: We load Go plugins at runtime using Yaegi.
- No third party tools allowed: Only standard golang library and this provider libraries.
- Configuration of the provider and resources are based on JSON strings: Very dynamic, flexible and Go and Terraform have first class support for marshal/unmarshaling easily.
- Simplified small API: Designed and implemented focusing on maintainability, easy development and lowering the need of a user understanding low level terraform concepts.

## Terraform cloud

The provider is portable, it's compatible with terraform cloud workers out of the box.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    goplugin = {
      source = "slok/goplugin"
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `resource_plugins_v1` (Attributes Map) The Block of resource plugins using v1 API that will be loaded by the provider. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--resource_plugins_v1))

<a id="nestedatt--resource_plugins_v1"></a>
### Nested Schema for `resource_plugins_v1`

Required:

- `configuration` (String, Sensitive) A JSON string object with the properties that will be passed to the plugin creation/initialization, the plugin is responsible of knowing how to load and use these properties (e.g: API tokens).
- `source_code` (List of String) The Source code of the plugin, allows multiple file data but must be of the same package.
